# Project Overview {.section}

## Key Research Questions

- **What factors drive demand for Airbnb properties in Berlin?**
- **Which neighborhoods command premium prices and why?**
- **What makes certain properties more expensive than others?**
- **How can hosts optimize their listings for maximum returns?**

## Our Approach

1. Define a demand proxy measure from available data
2. Analyze neighborhood price patterns
3. Identify key price determinants
4. Model demand relationships
5. Create simulations to visualize effects
6. Develop actionable recommendations

# Target Variable & Data {.section}

## Measuring "Demand" for Airbnbs

Without direct booking data, we created a proxy variable based on:

- **Review Frequency**: More reviews = more bookings
- **Availability**: Lower availability = higher demand

```
demand_proxy = review_score * (1 - availability_score)
```

```{r demand-proxy, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.width=10, fig.height=6}
# Visualization of the demand proxy calculation would be shown here
```

## Berlin Airbnb Dataset

- 12,000+ listings across all Berlin neighborhoods
- Detailed property characteristics
- Host information and status
- Price and fee data
- Rating data (overall and subcategories)
- Availability and booking metrics

# Berlin's Expensive Neighborhoods {.section}

## Price Variation by Neighborhood

Berlin shows significant price variation across neighborhoods:

```{r neighborhood-prices, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.width=10, fig.height=6}
# Visualization of neighborhood price comparison would be shown here
```

## Most Expensive Areas

1. **Mitte**: €80/night (median)
   - Central location, major tourist attractions
   - Business district, premium amenities

2. **Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf**: €70/night
   - Upscale shopping, Berlin Zoo
   - Traditional luxury district

3. **Prenzlauer Berg**: €65/night
   - Family-friendly, trendy cafes
   - Historic architecture, parks

## Price-to-Demand Relationship

Not all expensive neighborhoods have highest demand:

```{r price-demand-map, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.width=10, fig.height=6}
# Visualization of price vs. demand by neighborhood would be shown here
```

# What Makes a Property Expensive? {.section}

## Key Price Determinants

Our analysis identified these key factors driving higher prices:

```{r price-factors, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.width=10, fig.height=6}
# Visualization of price determinants would be shown here
```

## Location Premium

- **Central locations** command 30-50% premium
- **Tourist attractions** within walking distance add 15-25%
- **Transit access** impacts price by 5-15%

```{r location-premium, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.width=10, fig.height=6}
# Visualization of location price impact would be shown here
```

## Property Characteristics

- **Each bedroom** adds ~25% to price
- **Entire homes** priced 40% higher than private rooms
- **Premium amenities** (pool, doorman) add 15-20%
- **Superhost status** adds 8% premium on average

```{r property-premium, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.width=10, fig.height=6}
# Visualization of property characteristics impact would be shown here
```

# Property Ratings & Price {.section}

## Rating Distribution

Berlin listings generally have high ratings:

```{r rating-distribution, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.width=10, fig.height=6}
# Rating distribution visualization would be shown here
```

## Rating Impact on Price

- Properties rated 4.8+ can charge 5-10% premium
- Rating impact varies by neighborhood
- Cleanliness ratings particularly important

```{r rating-price, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.width=10, fig.height=6}
# Visualization of rating impact on price would be shown here
```

# Model Development {.section}

## Feature Engineering

- Dummy variables for categorical features
- PCA for dimensionality reduction
- Neighborhood-specific features
- Price range categorization

## Model Performance

```{r model-comparison, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.width=10, fig.height=6}
# Model comparison visualization would be shown here
```

## Feature Importance

```{r feature-importance, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.width=10, fig.height=6}
# Feature importance visualization would be shown here
```

# Demand Simulation Results {.section}

## Ratings Impact on Demand

```{r ratings-impact, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.width=10, fig.height=6}
# Ratings impact visualization would be shown here
```

## Price Sensitivity

```{r price-sensitivity, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.width=10, fig.height=6}
# Price sensitivity visualization would be shown here
```

## Room Type Effect

```{r room-type, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.width=10, fig.height=6}
# Room type visualization would be shown here
```

## Superhost Advantage

```{r superhost, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.width=10, fig.height=6}
# Superhost visualization would be shown here
```

# Neighborhood-Specific Insights {.section}

## Price-Optimized Strategies by Area

Different neighborhoods require different approaches:

1. **Mitte & Tourist Centers**
   - Premium pricing works with exceptional quality
   - Focus on professional photos, amenities
   
2. **Up-and-Coming Areas**
   - Competitive pricing more important
   - Emphasize value and local experience
   
3. **Outer Districts**
   - Price sensitivity highest
   - Highlight transit connections, space advantages

## The Balancing Act: Price vs. Occupancy

```{r price-occupancy, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.width=10, fig.height=6}
# Price vs. occupancy visualization would be shown here
```

# Recommendations for Hosts {.section}

## Location-Based Strategy

- **Premium locations**: Focus on quality over price competition
- **Mid-tier neighborhoods**: Find your niche and highlight area benefits
- **Outer districts**: Emphasize value, space, and unique attributes
