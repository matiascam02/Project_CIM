# Understanding the Simulation Results and Overfitting Issues

## Problem: Model Overfitting

The demand prediction model shows signs of severe overfitting:

- R-squared value is extremely high (0.9988)
- RMSE is extremely low (0.0061)
- Simulation results show minimal variation across different feature values

## Impact on Simulations

Overfitting causes the model to essentially 'memorize' the training data rather than learning generalizable patterns. This results in:

1. Almost identical predictions regardless of feature changes
2. Unrealistic stability in predicted demand across dramatically different property characteristics
3. Limited actionable insights from the simulations

## Mitigation in Current Simulations

The updated simulation script attempts to mitigate these issues by:

1. Creating multiple reference properties with random variation
2. Testing more extreme feature values to force greater variation
3. Clearly labeling the simulations with overfitting warnings

## Long-term Solutions

For more meaningful simulations, consider rebuilding the model with:

1. Regularization to prevent overfitting
2. Cross-validation during model training
3. Simplified model with fewer features
4. Different algorithm less prone to overfitting (e.g., regularized regression)

## Interpreting Current Results

Despite the limitations, the relative differences between feature values may still provide some directional insights, even if the absolute magnitudes of the differences are unrealistically small.
