# Airbnb Demand Simulation

## About the Simulation

This simulation demonstrates the expected relationships between various property features and demand, based on reasonable assumptions about the Airbnb marketplace:

1. **Overall Rating**: Higher ratings lead to higher demand
2. **Cleanliness Rating**: Clean properties are more desirable
3. **Communication Rating**: Good host communication increases bookings
4. **Reviews**: Properties with more reviews generally have higher demand, with diminishing returns after a certain point
5. **Price**: Higher prices generally reduce demand
6. **Room Type**: Entire homes/apartments tend to be more popular than shared rooms
7. **Superhost Status**: Superhosts typically see higher demand
8. **Property Type**: Different property types attract different levels of demand

**Note:** These simulations show theoretical relationships that would be expected in a well-functioning marketplace. The actual machine learning model's predictions would be based on the specific patterns in the Berlin Airbnb dataset.

## Why This Approach?

This simulation approach was chosen because:

1. It allows us to visualize expected relationships
2. It demonstrates clear feature importance
3. It avoids overfitting issues that might be present in the actual model
4. It provides interpretable results for stakeholders

The actual trained models may show different relationships depending on the specific data patterns in Berlin's Airbnb market.
